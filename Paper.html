					<p>Computers have become a part of everyday life. Anywhere from having a smart home to checking an email, the ease of access and communication benefits everyone in today’s society. In healthcare, computers are used for a variety of tasks. From storing medical records to monitoring health through IoT devices, this is health informatics, and it has revolutionized the health industry over the past 60 years.</p>
					<p>According to Rachel Rizal, M.D., a writer for U.S. News, computer-use allowed the healthcare field to compute large data analysis among other things. This analysis “allows researchers to find patterns and analyze extremely large datasets,” a task without a computer would take much more time. This advanced data analysis also comes with the ability to model the datasets much easier, again cutting down the time required. In recent times, COVID-19 was tracked using computer technology and was able to be contained through the advancements in medicine. The speed of research that was underwent was only available because of computers, and without it, the vaccine that saved millions of lives would have been years away from production.</p>
					<p>A much smaller, more relevant scale of computer science includes telemedicine. This includes at-home doctor appointments streamed on a phone or computer, allowing the patient the ease of access and safety to attend the appointment from their home. This practice was extensively used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it allowed no-risk wellness checks. In addition to streaming appointments, the public was also informed of the status of the pandemic. This meant that an individual could stay healthy by monitoring the spread from their phone while avoiding public areas.</p>
					<p>A necessity for managing today’s population in healthcare is handling and storing patient records. Before computing, all records were kept on paper. After, records were kept on paper and edited on computers to be printed out. Now, most records are kept on a mass storage device (EMRs) with an audit trail to keep them secure while having the accessibility that modern life requires. While the records are stored online, this allows some to be used for research by “securely anonymizing or pseudonymizing” the patients’ personal information to provide data while maintaining privacy. This allows medical researchers to study and “help identify causes, factors of, or contributors to diseases” (Al-Zubaidie).</p>
					<p>Wearable sensors connected to smartphone mobile apps, also called IoT devices, have made a drastic change in personal healthcare. An example of this is a smartwatch with heartbeat sensors can help detect irregular heartrates that would’ve gone unnoticed and could worsen (Miller). Another example of wearable sensors is a project by Nikil Dutt, a professor of computer science, named UNITE. The project “provides services so that underserved pregnant women can take better care of themselves.” This is done by monitoring the patient continuously, instead of only during face-to-face visits (Shani). These sensors can report directly to the patient’s phone via app or to their doctor, who can analyze the data to recommend an effective treatment plan.</p>
					<p>Computer science applications also include artificial intelligence. Using machine learning to aid in medical decision-making has been shown to increase accuracy by more than 8% (MIT News). In a study by MIT, artificial intelligence was used to detect cancer by being given data including chest X-rays. While doctors can handle multiple variables at a time with diagnoses, a computer can handle an exponential number of variables. As Angelica Sharma, a guest writer from County Line adopts from a Harvard report, this “makes it possible for [computers] to make better decisions than humans when faced with complex situations.”</p>
					<p>While artificial intelligence can be applied in any area of healthcare, it is still new and developing. Systems that integrated AI have mostly only done so on a diagnostic level. On this level, doctors collaborate with the intelligence and can “reveal subtle patterns in data, which can then be interpreted by clinicians to identify new clinical and health-related issues” (Choudhury). With the added supervision of doctors, this allows the AI to “learn” with data while still producing needed information that would help in personalized treatment. While the AI learns, the output is increasingly accurate and will one day be used independently to offer treatment plans based on an individual’s factors such as age, weight, specific disease, and more. (Choudhury) Also, since machine intelligence is more available than a doctor, this could overall reduce the risk of diseases spreading, but this implementation is at the clinical level approach, which is still in heavy development.</p>
					<p>Expanding on the possibility of artificial intelligence in healthcare, a robotic healthcare company, named Intuitive Surgical, produced what is called the da Vinci Surgical System. According to Intuitive’s website, their systems offer increased efficiency in “minimally invasive surgery across a wide spectrum of surgical procedures” (Intuitive). The da Vinci robot line assists surgeons with difficult procedures by giving them access to view a perspective or with accuracy that only a machine can provide. This accuracy means that patients will have minimal scaring or after-surgical problems and will be able to recover easier than without the robotic assistance. While the da Vinci robot was first created in 2000, the company has continuously updated and upgraded the machine. Intuitive Surgical claims that the machine has operated in over 7 million surgeries ranging from prostatectomies to transoral surgery for head and neck cancer. Some criticism for the da Vinci includes its $2 million price (making it too pricey for many colleges to have the equipment to educate pre-meds) and that the software for the machine cannot be modified, as it is proprietary software.</p>
					<p>As computers continue to increase in performance, the use of computer science in any industry will also increase. For the healthcare industry, the major changes brought on by COVID-19 resulted in increased use of telemedicine, cloud data analysis, and wearable sensors. While artificial intelligence has yet to be used without doctor collaboration, the possibilities it holds weighs heavily on the future of healthcare.</p>
					<p>While the advancements in health and medicine made possible by computer science with the aid of artificial intelligence seems to come with many benefits, it also brings heavy drawbacks. One of these include data attacks, such as phishing (fraudulent communication to retrieve personal information). With medical history and other personal data being stored behind passwords, phishing attacks can lead to loss of privacy information for individuals. While this is a constant battle for cyber security analysts, the method to protect private contents usually includes adding a multiple-factor authentication system. Modern day, these systems are usually forced if the information being held is important and must not be lost, such as school and bank systems. The name implies that multiple factors are used to authenticate a person before being allowed into the account. These factors are usually the initial password, a security question, a one-time-use code sent to an approved email, or more recently, a call or text sent to an approved number. These added measures ensure that it is near impossible to gain unauthorized entry into accounts, a necessity for healthcare accounts.</p>
					<p>While multiple-factor authentication is an improvement in the security of personal accounts, it is far from a perfect system. Security in general will always have a work around, as an example, phishing is tricking the individual to giving up vital information and does not have to include going through an authentication system. To protect systems, organizations create emails tied to each other by the organization that can have added filters that block fraudulent emails or other cyber-attacks. In healthcare, these organization emails are practically always in use, especially in the United States, where healthcare is handled in the private sector.</p>
					<p>While cyber-attacks and data breaches affect healthcare systems, it is just one of the many drawbacks that comes with computer science’s implementation. These drawbacks continue to slow growth of the industry, but do not stop growth as the uses for computer science increases in the industry.</p>
